<p>In this talk,we will focus on two fundamental problems in Lattice Theory, First one is Shortest Vector Problem (SVP) where we find shortest non-zero vector in Lattice. The other one is Closet Vector Problem (CVP) where we find closet Lattice point of a given vector. These problems have applications in Integer Factorization, post-Quantum Cryptography. Security of the lattice-based cryptosystem is based on the hardness of these problems. We will show that both the problems are NP-hard within some constant approximation factor.</p>

<p>No prior knowledge related to lattice is required.</p>

<p>Given a multiset of n positive integers and a target integer t, the SubsetSum problem asks to determine whether there exists a subset of S that sums up to t. Bringmann (SODAâ€™17) gave a randomized O(n+t) time algorithm (hiding polylogarithmic factors) which is believed to be near optimal. In this paper, Jin and Wu (Wu is a high school student in China!) give a very simple and elegant randomized algorithm matching the running time of Bringmann.</p>

<p>This paper follows the approach of using algebraic techniques (manipulating polynomials) to design faster algorithms for hard combinatorial problems. Time permitting, we shall discuss some of the other recent applications of this approach.</p>
