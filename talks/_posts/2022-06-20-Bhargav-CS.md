## Abstract

James Bond has infiltrated the criminal organisation Spectre. Unfortunately, to communicate with the outside world, he has no fancy equipment but just five neck ties that he can wear each day: Red, Blue, Green, Purple and Beige. Using fancy satellite imaging, the people at MI6 can see the colour of 007's tie.

The ties have not really been washed (Bond was busy with other things) and so it is hard to tell apart some colours. One cannot distinguish Red from Purple nor from Beige. Similarly, it is not possible to reliably distinguish Beige from Red nor Green, Green from Beige nor Blue, Blue from Green nor Purple and Purple from Blue nor Red. But there is no problem distinguishing Purple from both Beige and Green for example.

What is the most efficient way for Bond to communicate reliably? Using some Linear Algebra and the help of Abel Prize winner L치szl칩 Lov치sz, we will figure it out!

**Prerequisites**: Some knowledge of basic Linear Algebra.
