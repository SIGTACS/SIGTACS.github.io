## Abstract

Given $(a_1, \dots, a_n, t) \in Z_{\geq 0}^{n + 1} $, the Subset Sum problem is to decide whether there exists $S \subseteq [n]$ such that $\sum_{i \in S} a_i = t$.  Bellman (1957) gave a pseudopolynomial time dynamic programming algorithm which solves the Subset Sum in $O(nt)$ time and $O(t)$ space.

In this talk, we present an $\tilde{O}(k \cdot (n+t))$ time deterministic algorithm, which finds the hamming weight of all the realisable sets for a subset sum instance. Our algorithm is parameterized by $k$, which is a given upper bound on the number of realisable sets (i.e. number of solutions, summing exactly $t$). We will also show that Subset Sum problem with a unique solution is already NP-hard, under randomized reduction. This makes the regime of parametrized algorithms, in terms of $k$, very interesting.
