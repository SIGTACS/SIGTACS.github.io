## Abstract

Read Once ABPs (RO) are polynomial computational models where the order of variable multiplication is crucial. Though highly restrictive, they are one of the few models for which algebraic lower-bounds results have been known for a while. This talk will discuss the lower bounds of a natural generalisation called the sum of RO.

We will explore a well-known technique of proving algebraic lower bounds called the Partial Derivative method, which could be a topic of general interest for those interested in complexity theory.

The talk is based on the work of V Arvind and S Raja from 2015 - "Some Lower Bound Results for Set-Multilinear Arithmetic Computations".
