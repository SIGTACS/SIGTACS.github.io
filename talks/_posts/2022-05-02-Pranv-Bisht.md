## Abstract

Given a sparse multivariate polynomial with s-many monomials, the problem of sparse polynomial factorization asks for an efficient algorithm to factor the given polynomial. We discuss state of the art for this problem. In particular, we will discuss the connection of this problem with a geometrical/combinatorial object called Newton polytopes. We shall mainly discuss my recent joint work with Prof. Nitin Saxena, which shows a poly-time deterministic algorithm for this problem, when the input is a symmetric polynomial.
