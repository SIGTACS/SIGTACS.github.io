## Abstract

The talk basically focused on the fundamentals of Multivariate Cryptography. Multivariate Cryptography is also considered a post-quantum secure. I will detail the basic construction of RAINBOW. If time permits (or in the next talk), I will present the recent attacks on RAINBOW by  Ward Beullens.
