<p>Unambiguous computation is a restriction of nondeterministic computation where the nondeterministic machine has at most one accepting computation path on each input.  In logspace computation these classes are know as NL and UL.  An important question is whether these classes are equal or not. This question is equivalent to asking whether the reachability in directed graphs can be solved in UL or not. In this talk I will present a result which showed that reachability in O(log n) genus directed graphs can be solved in UL.</p>

<p>A randomness extractor is a function that outputs almost uniform bits from a weakly random entropy source. The Leftover Hash Lemma (LHL) states that universal hash functions are good randomness extractors. LHL leads to simple and efficient extractors and hence has applications in many areas of cryptography and complexity theory.</p>

<p>In this talk, the speaker will give a short description of extractors, discuss the proof for LHL and give a simple application of LHL.</p>

<p>Reachability and strong-connectivity are some of the fundamental graph problems. In the static setting, both problems can be solved in O(m+n) time for any directed graph G with n vertices and m edges. However, most real-world networks are prone to failures. The failures are transient and occur for a small duration of time. Under such a setting, we would like to preprocess the graph to compute data-structures that can achieve robustness by being functional even after the occurrence of failures. In recent years, researchers have studied various questions pertaining to connectivity, distances, routing, min-cuts, etc. in the domain of fault tolerance networks.</p>

<p>In this talk, the speaker will discuss the following questions:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Can we compute a reachability tree in just linear time, after the occurrence of a small number of failures?</li>
  <li>How fast can we compute the strongly connected components, again on the occurrence of failures?</li>
  <li>Does there exist a sparse certificate for these structures that remains valid even after a bounded number of failures?</li>
</ol>

<p>The solutions to these problems employ extremely basic tools like max-flows, min-cuts, and heavy-path-decomposition.</p>

<p>The approximation closure of a class of polynomials A is another class of polynomials which can approximate the polynomials of A in an appropriate sense. Motivated from the problem of checking separation of these classes, recently a class of small-width algebraic branching programs (ABP) and its approximation closure were studied. In this talk, we will discuss some of those central findings.</p>

<p>In the first half of the talk, we will set the prelude by discussing briefly on introduction to arithmetic circuits, algebraic branching program (ABP) and some popular algebraic complexity classes like VF, VBP and their approximation closures. In the latter half, we will discuss how the introduced classes are related to each other and with their approximation closure. And if time permits, we can also look into Fibonacci polynomials, Fibonacci complexity and Border Fibonacci complexity of polynomials.</p>

<p>Today, datasets (such as social-networks) have become prohibitively large to store on a single system. The streaming setting models this problem. Here, an algorithm works a small memory (typically, logarithmic in size of the input) and solves the problem by repeatedly traversing the input. In this talk, we introduce the communication problem, where two or more systems have to jointly perform a task that neither can finish individually. We look at several communication problems and surprisingly find that they can be used to study the “hardness” of problems in the streaming setting.</p>

<p>This talk would be interesting for students with interest in algorithms and probability. It would be helpful for those working in other areas, who would like to explore streaming and/or communication complexity. Finally, many references to the latest research would be useful for those working in these fields.</p>

<p>The talk will be accessible through high-school level math, and yet, will introduce interesting ideas from probability theory, information theory, and communication complexity. At the end of the talk, we will provide a comprehensive list of references for further reading.</p>
