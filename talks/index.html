<p>This talk will start with an overview of the relatively young field of QBF proof complexity, explaining QBF proof systems (including QBF resolution) and an assessment of which lower bound techniques are available for QBF proof systems. In the main part of the talk, I will explain hardness characterisations for QBF proof systems in terms of circuit complexity, yielding very direct connections between circuit lower bounds and QBF proof system lower bounds.</p>

<p>Matroids are abstract structures which generalize the notion of linear independence in vector spaces. This lead to surprising connections to graph theory, combinatorial optimization, and topology. In this talk, we would introduce the idea of matroids in simple words, look at the idea of matroid intersection, and a greedy algorithm for finding it.

<p>Barrington’s theorem is a result in classical complexity which
states that any boolean function in NC^1 can be computed by a branching
program of bounded width. We will discuss the proof of this surprising
theorem.</p>

<p>The tensor product GxH of two graphs G and H has the vertex set $V(G)\times V(H)$, and the pairs $(g,h)$ and $(g’,h’)$ are adjacent if and only if $g$ is adjacent to $g`$ in G and $h$ is adjacent to $h$ in H. A proper colouring $g \to C(g)$ for graph $G$ can be ‘lifted’ to give a proper colouring $(g,h) \to C(g)$ for $G \times H$, and similarly a lifting can be done for a proper colouring of H as well. This implies that the minimum between the chromatic numbers of $G$ and $H$ forms an upper bound on the chromatic number of $G \times H$ (i.e, $X(G \times H) \leq \min(X(G), X(H)$). In 1966, S. Hedetniemi conjectured that equality holds for all finite simple graphs. In 2019, Yaroslav Shitov refuted the conjecture by constructing a counterexample using the concept of exponential graphs, which have vertices corresponding to every possible c-colouring of an n-vertex graph, with two vertices being adjacent only if the corresponding colourings paint every adjacent vertex with different colours.</p>

<p>In this talk, we will discuss exponential graphs in detail, and then look at the construction of the counterexample.</p>

<p>Cryptographic hash functions are widely used in modern cryptography such as in digital signatures, message integrity and authentication. The U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) announced the “NIST hash function competition” for the Secure Hash Algorithm-3 (SHA-3) in 2006. They received 64 proposals from around the world. Among these, KECCAK designed by Bertoni, Daemen, Peeters, and Van Assche became one of the candidates for SHA-3. It won the competition in October 2012 and was standardized as a “Secure Hash Algorithm 3” .</p>

<p>In this talk, we will look at new preimage attacks on KECCAK-384 and KECCAK-512 for 2, 3 and 4 rounds. The attacks are based on non-linear structures (structures that contain quadratic terms). These structures were studied by Guo et al. and Li et al. to give preimage attacks on round reduced KECCAK. We carefully construct non-linear structures such that the quadratic terms are not spread across the whole state. This allows us to create more linear equations between the variables and hash values, leading to better preimage attacks. As a result, we get the best theoretical preimage attack on KECCAK-384 and KECCAK-512 for 2 and 3-rounds and also KECCAK-384 for 4-rounds.</p>

<p>Hilbert’s Nullstellensatz is an important theorem in Commutative Algebra and Algebraic Geometry. It connects the notion of ideals (in Commutative Algebra) to that of varieties (in Algebraic Geometry). In this project, we investigate the computational version of this problem (HN) which basically translates to finding how hard is it to decide whether or not 1 lies in the ideal generated by a set of polynomials, say {f1, f2, …, fm} in k[x1, x2, …, xn]. In particular, we look at the two most important results pertaining to the complexity of the above problem (for field k of zero-characteristic): HN is in PSPACE, and under Generalized Riemann Hypothesis, HN is in AM.</p>

<p>In this talk, we will explore the problem of Polynomial Identity Testing (PIT) which is of finding an algorithm that checks if a given polynomial is zero or not in polynomial time. The problem is central to the field of Algebraic complexity and has known connections to lower bounds, as well as other problems in complexity theory. It has a simple randomized black-box solution but a deterministic algorithm is not known.</p>

<p>We will take a look at the restricted class of circuits of depth-4 constant Top and Bottom Fan-in. Solving the problem for the depth-4 case will imply a solution for the general PIT using depth reduction in [AV08]. The case of constant top Fan in depth-3 has been solved for both white-box [KS07] and black-box [SS13] cases. Thus, this remains the next unsolved case in the field, for which even the white-box solution is not known. We will look at the conjectures in [Gup14] of Sylvester-Gallai type theorems for non-linear polynomials proposed to solve the case, and prove one of the easier conjectures for quadratic polynomials from [Shp18].</p>

<p>This will be a series of 2 or 3 tutorial talks about factoring and root finding of a univariate polynomial f(x) mod a prime power p^k. The case of factoring f(x) mod p (special case k=1) is a very fundamental problem in computational number theory and theoretical computer science and finds applications in (but not limited to) cryptography, coding theory and other areas of mathematics. This problem has known efficient randomized algorithms but finding an efficient deterministic algorithm has been an enigma.</p>

<p>On the contrary, the general version of the problem, factoring f(x) mod p^k, has no known efficient randomized algorithm yet. The main objective of this talk series is to talk about the recent discoveries which takes us closer to this goal and also make aware the audience about the hurdles in the way. Mainly, an intuitive understanding of the problem will be given along with efficient randomized algorithm (Berthomieu, Lecerf and Quintin [BLQ13]) for finding roots, recent derandomization of [BLQ13] (D., Mittal and Saxena CCC’19) and factoring f(x) mod p^k for k&lt;5 (D., Mittal and Saxena ISSAC’19).</p>

<p><strong>Update 1</strong> Talk was continued on 13th Nov 2019 at 3PM in KD102.</p>

<p><strong>Update 2</strong> Final part of the talk will be delivered by speaker on 15th Nov 2019 at 5PM in KD103</p>

<p>In this talk, we will define the ABP (Algebraic branching program) model of computation, followed by non-commutative and read once oblivious ABPs (ROABPs). Nisan [Nis91] gave an exact characterization to determine the size and width of non commutative ABPs which will be the highlight of this talk . We will also derive the same characterization in the language of ROABPs.</p>

<p>Unambiguous computation is a restriction of nondeterministic computation where the nondeterministic machine has at most one accepting computation path on each input.  In logspace computation these classes are know as NL and UL.  An important question is whether these classes are equal or not. This question is equivalent to asking whether the reachability in directed graphs can be solved in UL or not. In this talk I will present a result which showed that reachability in O(log n) genus directed graphs can be solved in UL.</p>
