### Abstract

Vazirani and Vidick (2011) introduced a protocol which outputs random bits from a small seed input, using a pair of quantum mechanical devices. Any user can certify the randomness of these bits with a simple classical test. I will be covering all the necessary prerequisites needed to understand the protocol as well.
