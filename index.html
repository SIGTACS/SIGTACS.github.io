<p>In view of the lack of strong lower bounds in most branches of complexity theory, some of the research has focused on whether the known approaches can ever lead to strong enough results. In the case of Boolean circuits, Razborov and Rudich (1995) observed that most of the then known lower bounds could be proven using a certain template, which they called the ‘natural proofs’ framework. They further showed that if strong enough One-Way-Functions exist, then no natural proof can lead to a super-polynomial lower bound against Boolean circuits!</p>

<p>Recently, Forbes, Shpilka and Volk (2018) and Grochow, Kumar, Saks and Saraf (2017) independently came up with an algebraic analogue of the natural proofs framework: algebraic or (algebraically) natural proofs. A bit like the Boolean case, both these works show that the existence of algebraic natural proofs for poly-sized algebraic circuits (called VP) directly contradicts a derandomisation assumption about algebraic circuits. However, this assumption is quite non-standard and it is therefore difficult to form any strong opinion about it.</p>

<p>In a recent joint work with Mrinal Kumar (IITB), C. Ramya (TIFR) and Ramprasad Satharishi (TIFR), we show that if there is an exponential separation between the classes VNP (algebraic NP) and VP (algebraic P), then there are no algebraic natural proofs for the class VNP. This is perhaps the only known result about the existence of algebraic natural proofs that follows from standard hardness assumptions. Moreover, this statement also has some interesting consequences for the efficacy of ‘natural lower bound techniques’ in the algebraic world.</p>

<p>In this talk, we will first get to know the framework of algebraic natural proofs, and then discuss our result and its consequences. After that, if the time permits, we will briefly go over the main ideas behind our proof.</p>

<p>Polynomial Identity Testing (PIT) is a fundamental problem in theoretical computer science . The problem is about finding an efficient algorithm to test if a given algebraic expression (for example, x^2-y^2=(x+y)(x-y) ) is an identity (LHS=RHS). Equivalently, the problem is to test whether a given algebraic formula computing a multivariate polynomial is identically zero or not. It may seem to be a trivial problem, as we can expand the polynomial, compute all its coefficients and check if they are zero. This is a correct algorithm, but the running time is exponential as there are exponentially many monomials in a generic n-variate degree d polynomial. A simple idea (check if the polynomial is zero at a random point) gives a more efficient (randomized polynomial time) algorithm, but the algorithm may mistakenly output zero for a non zero polynomial. Luckily the probability of error is really small, so this algorithm works in practice.</p>

<p>Can we give a deterministic polynomial time algorithm? There is strong evidence that there exists such an algorithm. Finding a solution would be a major breakthrough as it would solve several problems in computer science.</p>

<p>Last decade has seen continuous progress in this area, several special cases are now solved and strong reduction results are known. In this workshop we will start from the basics and go on till we see a few state of the art results. The prerequisite for understanding the talks is minimal, basic understanding of linear algebra and algorithms should be sufficient.</p>
