<p>Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP)is one of the central computational problems studied in complexity theory. In this work, we focus on the streaming model where the input is a sequence of constraints and the goal is to approximate the maximum number of satisfied constraints using space as small as possible.</p>

<p>Unlike the traditional setting, there have been very few results in the streaming model. A recent line of works culminating in [Kapralov-Krachun, STOC 2019]shows that $(1/2+\varepsilon)$-approximation for Max-CUT requires $\Omega(n)$ space while there is a trivial $1/2$-approximation using $O(\log n)$ space. However, the knowledge of the right approximation ratio for other boolean 2CSP in the streaming model remains elusive. Specifically, prior to this work, there is a $2/5$-approximation for Max-DICUT while the hardness side only refutes $1/2$-approximation [Guruswami-Velingker-Velusamy, APPROX-RANDOM 2017].</p>

<p>In this work, we show that, surprisingly, the right approximation ratio for Max-DICUT in the streaming model is $4/9$. Furthermore, we settle down the right approximation ratios for all the boolean 2CSP in the streaming model. The techniques we are using are random samplings and reductions from the distributional boolean hidden matching problem (DBHP).</p>

<p>This is joint work with Santhoshini Velusamy and Sasha Golonev.</p>

<p>Polynomial Identity Testing (PIT) is a fundamental problem in theoretical computer science . The problem is about finding an efficient algorithm to test if a given algebraic expression (for example, x^2-y^2=(x+y)(x-y) ) is an identity (LHS=RHS). Equivalently, the problem is to test whether a given algebraic formula computing a multivariate polynomial is identically zero or not. It may seem to be a trivial problem, as we can expand the polynomial, compute all its coefficients and check if they are zero. This is a correct algorithm, but the running time is exponential as there are exponentially many monomials in a generic n-variate degree d polynomial. A simple idea (check if the polynomial is zero at a random point) gives a more efficient (randomized polynomial time) algorithm, but the algorithm may mistakenly output zero for a non zero polynomial. Luckily the probability of error is really small, so this algorithm works in practice.</p>

<p>Can we give a deterministic polynomial time algorithm? There is strong evidence that there exists such an algorithm. Finding a solution would be a major breakthrough as it would solve several problems in computer science.</p>

<p>Last decade has seen continuous progress in this area, several special cases are now solved and strong reduction results are known. In this workshop we will start from the basics and go on till we see a few state of the art results. The prerequisite for understanding the talks is minimal, basic understanding of linear algebra and algorithms should be sufficient.</p>
