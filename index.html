<p>The talk is based on joint work with Prof. Nitin Saxena. We explore blackbox PIT (Polynomial Identity Testing) problem for the model of “Sum of ROABPs (Read-once oblivious Algebraic Branching Programs)”. Recent bootstrapping results motivate us to study log-variate ROABPs. We also restrict the width of ROABP to a constant but study the more general sum-of-ROABPs model. We give the first poly($s$)-time blackbox PIT for sum of constant-many, size-$s$, $O(\log s)$-variate constant-width ROABPs. The
previous best for this model was a quasi-polynomial time which is comparable to brute-force in the log-variate setting. Also, we handle unbounded-many such ROABPs if each ROABP computes a homogeneous polynomial.</p>

<p>Our new techniques comprise– (1) a ROABP computing a homogeneous polynomial can be made syntactically homogeneous in the same width; and (2) overcome the hurdle of unknown variable order in sum-of-ROABPs in the log-variate setting (over any field).</p>

<p>In the talk, we will begin from scratch with definitions of PIT and various models including ROABPs. Then, we shall discuss the motivations behind this model and its non-triviality. Finally, we will give a brief overview of the PIT algorithms and why they work.</p>

<p>Polynomial Identity Testing (PIT) is a fundamental problem in theoretical computer science . The problem is about finding an efficient algorithm to test if a given algebraic expression (for example, x^2-y^2=(x+y)(x-y) ) is an identity (LHS=RHS). Equivalently, the problem is to test whether a given algebraic formula computing a multivariate polynomial is identically zero or not. It may seem to be a trivial problem, as we can expand the polynomial, compute all its coefficients and check if they are zero. This is a correct algorithm, but the running time is exponential as there are exponentially many monomials in a generic n-variate degree d polynomial. A simple idea (check if the polynomial is zero at a random point) gives a more efficient (randomized polynomial time) algorithm, but the algorithm may mistakenly output zero for a non zero polynomial. Luckily the probability of error is really small, so this algorithm works in practice.</p>

<p>Can we give a deterministic polynomial time algorithm? There is strong evidence that there exists such an algorithm. Finding a solution would be a major breakthrough as it would solve several problems in computer science.</p>

<p>Last decade has seen continuous progress in this area, several special cases are now solved and strong reduction results are known. In this workshop we will start from the basics and go on till we see a few state of the art results. The prerequisite for understanding the talks is minimal, basic understanding of linear algebra and algorithms should be sufficient.</p>
