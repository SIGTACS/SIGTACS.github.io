<p>The proof of the Kneser conjecture by Lovasz in 1978 gave rise to the field of topological combinatorics: applying topological and algebraic topological methods to combinatorial problems. In this talk, I will present some simple applications of the Borsuk Ulam theorem to discrete problems.</p>

<p>This will be a 2-lecture talk. The first one will be a short introduction to Expanders and some of their properties and their applications. In the second one, we will see the result by Marcus, Spielman and Shrivastava on the construction of infinite families of the best possible expanders.</p>
